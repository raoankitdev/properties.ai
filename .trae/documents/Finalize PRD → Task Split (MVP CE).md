**Inputs & Current State**
- Public docs updated: [PRD.MD](file:///c:/Projects/ai-real-estate-assistant/docs/PRD.MD), [ARCHITECTURE.md](file:///c:/Projects/ai-real-estate-assistant/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [ROADMAP.md](file:///c:/Projects/ai-real-estate-assistant/docs/ROADMAP.md), [DEPLOYMENT.md](file:///c:/Projects/ai-real-estate-assistant/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), [QUICKSTART.md](file:///c:/Projects/ai-real-estate-assistant/docs/QUICKSTART.md)
- Private backlog prepared: [MVP_TASKS.md](file:///c:/Projects/ai-real-estate-assistant/private/MVP_TASKS.md) (ignored by VCS) aligned with PRD; CE-only tasks; Pro features stubbed.

**Goal**
- Finalize PRD split into Taskmaster-style tasks/subtasks for MVP CE, verify completeness/consistency, and declare readiness.

**MVP CE Backlog (Epics → Tasks/Subtasks)**
- Chat Assistant
  - Backend SSE stream, provider routing, rate limits
  - Frontend streaming UI & session correlation
  - Tests: unit/integration/e2e; p95 targets
- Property Search (Hybrid)
  - Filters/sorting/geo; Chroma collections; reranker hooks
  - Frontend filters UI & neutral states
  - Tests: integration scenarios; correctness checks
- Local RAG
  - Upload pipeline (parse, chunk, embed) + QA endpoint
  - Storage/persist + cleanup
  - Tests: ingestion & QA; large-file edges
- Tools
  - Mortgage/Compare/Price/Location (existing) — validate UI & endpoints
  - New CE endpoints wired: valuation/legal/enrichment/CRM (stubs)
  - Tests: unit + integration; validation errors
- Saved Settings
  - Client-side preferences; settings page
  - Tests: serialize/persist
- Exports
  - CSV/JSON/Markdown endpoints + UI
  - Tests: content/locale/columns
- Prompt Templates
  - Template library + picker UI; apply endpoint
  - Tests: rendering/validation
- Deployment (BYOK)
  - Compose up, env flags; Quickstart flow verified
- QA & Security
  - ruff/mypy, RuleEngine clean; coverage targets (unit ≥90%, integration ≥70%, critical ≥90%)
  - CORS pinned; request IDs; no client secrets
- Docs (CE)
  - API Reference for tools; User Guide flows; Troubleshooting

**Acceptance Criteria (Per Epic)**
- Defined in [MVP_TASKS.md](file:///c:/Projects/ai-real-estate-assistant/private/MVP_TASKS.md); include latency targets, validation, error paths, and documentation done.

**Consistency & Robustness Checks**
- Traceability: Every PRD CE feature maps to at least one task with tests and docs.
- Architecture alignment: Interfaces/DI reflect [ARCHITECTURE.md]; Pro logic remains out-of-repo.
- Security: No secrets in client; env-only; rate limits; CORS in prod.
- Quality gates: RuleEngine + ruff/mypy + coverage thresholds.

**Taskmaster Readiness**
- Backlog structured and gated; tasks have clear DoR/DoD (in MVP_TASKS.md) and acceptance criteria.
- DevPipeline available for execution; RuleEngine validates code.

**Next Highest Priority Task**
- Frontend Integration for new Tools endpoints (valuation, legal-check, enrich-address, CRM sync): create forms/actions, error handling, render results, link to backend.
- Immediately after: Local RAG end-to-end (upload + QA UI) due to CE impact.

**Verification Plan (upon execution)**
- Run full test suite; ensure coverage thresholds met.
- Lint/type checks pass; RuleEngine reports no violations.
- Docs updated: API Reference, User Guide, Developer Notes.
- Planning artifacts updated: mark tasks complete, adjust estimates, update diagrams.

Approve to proceed: I will finalize any missing details in the private backlog (IDs, estimates), then implement the highest-priority task and follow the verification/commit/push flow as requested.
